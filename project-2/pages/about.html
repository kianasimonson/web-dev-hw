<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I love chocolate.</p>

I have the biggest sweet tooth known to family and friends. Not very often would I ever
turn down chocolate.

<b/>

Couple things about me, I have a Bachelor's of Science Degree in Business Management and
a certificate in Entertainment Management. I have a side passion to bake, because I'm always
in need of something sweet.

<b/>

I have lived in Missoula the past 4 years and there is no place I would rather be. I hope one
day to learn to bake many more extravegant desserts. I will always love a good Genie bar, nothing
is easier to make.
