# My First README.md
***
## Kiana Simonson

I am very ** overwhelmed ** at  * all * the new material I have already learned in just the * first couple weeks*.

I am very amazed at how many things I didn't know about such as:
* what the internet really was and how it worked.
* the World Wide Web and the Internet are two completely different things.

Even though the materials and assignments are a little overwhelming, I'm still very excited for what's to come in this class. Two things I believe that will be beneficial for me no matter what career path I take.
1. Building our own website.
2. Knowing how to manage and maintain our own website.

This will be so valuable knowing later on in life.


[GitHub](http://github.com) is like nothing I've ever used before, as well as Atom. By the end of the semester I will hopefully be a pro using both programs.

![Screenshot Of my Directory](./images/screenshot-1.ong) I believe my organizational skills will increasingly get better, even though I would say I'm organized  now.

Looking forward to learning more and hoping I can keep up with the pace.
