<h3>Topic 4 report</h3>
<hr />
Every week is so much new information and I am doing the best I can to keep up with it all.
<br />
<br />
Coding is still not something I fully comprehend, but I'm hoping with time it will come easier.
<br />

Project 2 is a fun way portraying the homework. I chose to do a recipe because my favorite thing to do is eat. lol Just kidding but not really, I really do love baking and cooking.
<br />

I'm excited to see how Project 2 turns out.

This week has definitely been more difficult then the last. I believe each week is going to get harder and harder, but I do feel like I am learning a lot. I think one of the hardest things for me is getting the coding right. I feel as if I follow the directions and put it exactly as it states but it only works half the time. When you have to incorporate things that have been saved in other files, I believe this is what I struggle with most. Images were the hardest and I never ended up getting it figured out right. I surprisingly had trouble getting my links to connect right as well, but finally got it to work. Hoping both these struggles change over time. At the beginning of the semester with the first assignment I wasn't able to get the coding right with the images either until after some advised help. I have gone about it numerous ways and still can't get the coding right to portray an image on the web page. Hoping it doesn't hurt me too much and I can eventually understand what I am doing wrong.

Topic 6

I was very proud of myself I ended up figuring out the coding for images. That was a small feat in the big scheme of things to do for this week.
