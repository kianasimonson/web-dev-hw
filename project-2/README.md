<h3>Topic 4 report</h3>
<hr />
Every week is so much new information and I am doing the best I can to keep up with it all.
<br />
<br />
Coding is still not something I fully comprehend, but I'm hoping with time it will come easier.
<br />

Project 2 is a fun way portraying the homework. I chose to do a recipe because my favorite thing to do is eat. lol Just kidding but not really, I really do love baking and cooking.
<br />

I'm excited to see how Project 2 turns out.

Project 2 continuation
This week has definitely been more difficult then the last. I believe each week is going to get harder and harder, but I do feel like I am learning a lot.
