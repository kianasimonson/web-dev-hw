  <h1>About me</h1>

  <h5> I love chocolate. </h5>

<br>
I have the biggest sweet tooth known to family and friends. Not very often would I ever
turn down chocolate.
<br/>

<br>
Couple things about me, I have a Bachelor's of Science Degree in Business Management and
a certificate in Entertainment Management. I have a passion for baking, because I'm always
in need of something sweet.
<br />

<br>
I have lived in Missoula the past 4 years and there is no place I would rather be. I hope one
day I learn to bake many more extravegant desserts. However, I will always love a good Genie bar, nothing
is easier to make.
