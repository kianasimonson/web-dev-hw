<h3>Topic 4 report<h3 />

Every week is so much new information and I am doing the best I can to keep up with it all.
<br />

<b>Coding</b> is still not something I fully comprehend, but I'm hoping with time it will come easier.

Project 2 is a fun way portraying the homework. I chose to do a recipe because my favorite thing to do is eat. lol Just kidding but not really, I really do love baking and cooking.
<br />

I'm excited to see how Project 2 turns out.
