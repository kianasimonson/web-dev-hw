  1. My site will be a book site.
<br>
  2. Invisible by James Patterson. For my writing example I haven't decided, but it will most likely come from
<a href=" http://www.jamespatterson.com/books/invisible#excerpts">these chapters.</a>
<br>
  3. I love every book I have read from James Patterson. He really knows how to make a mystery so entertaining. I always have trouble putting his books down.<br>
  James Patterson started writing at the age of nineteen from Newburgh, New York. Before becoming a writer he was set on track to become a professor and decided this wasn't the lifestyle for him. Invisible is an unbelievale book with a plot twist that will blow your mind. I always ponder on how authors come of with ideas such as these, but their imagination has to be wild.

  4. Color pallette:
  <br>
  #ff0000  #000000  #ffffff  #505050
  </br>
  5. I want to go with uneasy pictures that add to the mystery. I will definitely show the book cover for starters.
