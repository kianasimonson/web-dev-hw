    <p>  I <span style="color:red"><em>love</em></span> every book I have read from James Patterson. He really knows how to
      make a mystery so <span style="color:red">entertaining</span>. I always have trouble putting his books down.
      I understand this book is also written by David Ellis but I wanted to <span style="color:red">focus</span> on
      James Patterson because I admire his work and know more about it.
    </p>
  <p>
      James Patterson started writing at the age of <span style="color:red">nineteen</span> from Newburgh, New York.
      Before becoming a writer he was set on track to become a professor and decided this
      wasn't the lifestyle for him. <span style="color:red">Invisible</span> is an unbelievale book with a plot twist that will blow your mind. I always ponder on how authors come up with <u>ideas</u> such as these, but their <span style="color:red">imagination</span> has to be wild.
    </p>

      <span style="color:red">"I POP awake, gasping for air, the dancing flames on the ceiling receding to a dark,
      quiet room. I wipe sweat from my eyes with the conforter and shake away the remnants of the
      familiar nightmare, only this time with a twist: this time, the person in the bed wasn't me.
      This time, the person in the bed was prettier than me, smarter than me, braver than me, older
      than me. This time, the person in the bed was Marta."
